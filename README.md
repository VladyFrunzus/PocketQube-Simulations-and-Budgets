# PocketQube-Simulations-and-Budgets
This repository contains all the different budgets and simulations I had to compute for the PocketQube building project I took part for ESA FYS 4.

While the documents might not be exceptionally visually pleasing, they required a lot of work and research and most of the information contained in them is correct. 

Corrections:

- Homework 4 is based on certain assumptions from a FOSSA Systems mission, which might be open to intepretation.
- Homework 5 has an error when calculating the average time of a pass. The time is divided by 2.
- Homework 7's simulations are done for very specific conditions, which might not match with the real world ones.
